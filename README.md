## Backend Orientation: Menumatic

This orientation aims to familiarize anyone interested in running and testing this project. The backend environment is written in Java 17 using the Spring Boot framework. This tutorial covers only the backend aspect of the application, and assumes that the user is also running the [frontend tutorial](https://github.com/Daniel3178/menumatic/blob/master/README.md) to run the fullstack application.

**IDE:** IntelliJ Ultimate Edition is recommended, as this was the IDE used for this project hence the tutorial will be written with that in mind. You may however choose any other IDE that works best for you, following general instructions for how to setup what is described below.

### Spring Boot Dependencies
<small>Automatically included in the `pom.xml` file when cloning and running the project.</small>
- **Spring Web**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **Spring Data REST**
- **Spring JDBC**
- **Spring Boot Test**
- **Spring Mail**
- **Jackson Databind**
- **PostgreSQL JDBC Driver**


## Step by Step Instructions for Testing and Running the Backend Locally

### Install Apache Maven
- Download and install Maven from [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- Download the latest version, for example:  ```(e.g., apache-maven-3.8.5-bin.zip)```
- Extract the Zip file and choose a destination folder ```(e.g., C:\Program Files\Apache\)```


### Getting Started With Postgres (Windows)

- **Download and Install PostgreSQL 16**: 
  [Visit the official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

- **Add PostgreSQL 16 to Path Environment**:
  - Navigate to System Properties in Settings.
  - Click on Path Variables.
  - Navigate to "Path."
  - Locate the bin folder for PostgreSQL 16 on your system (e.g., `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin`). Add this path to your system's Path variables and press OK.


- **Creating a Database**:
  - Open the Command Line Interface (CLI) and type: 
    ```
    psql -U postgres
    ```
  - You may be asked to enter password. If you don't have one yet, press enter to skip.
  - After connecting to PostgreSQL, create a new database using the following SQL command.
    ```
    CREATE DATABASE database_name;
    ```
  - Connect to the newly created database.
    ```
    \c database_name
    ```
  - Now we must import the ```db_import.sql``` file which will generate the database schema for Menumatic.
  - Download the ```db_import.sql``` file from the [Menumatic Backend Github Page](https://github.com/team-havstrut-2024/menumatic-backend)
  - Locate to the directory it was downloaded onto (e.g., `C:\Dokument\Menumatic\Backend`) and copy path.
  - Now we must cd into the path in the CLI, and as such we must disconnect from the database:
    ```
    CTRL + c
    ```
  - Enter the path for the ```db_import.sql``` file (example): 
    ```
    cd C:\Dokument\Menumatic\Backend
    ```
  - Now connect back into the database using the step shown above.
  - Once connected we import the database schema dump:
    ```
    \i db_import.sql
    ```
  - To verify everything looks good you can enter ``` \dt ``` and the tables ought to be displayed.


### Getting Started (macOS - If not optimal, look for external tutorials.)

- **Download and Install PostgreSQL 16**: 
  [Visit the official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

- **Add PostgreSQL 16 to Path Environment**:
  - Open Terminal.
  - Edit your shell profile file (e.g., `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, or `.bashrc`) using a text editor like nano or vim. For example:
    ```
    nano ~/.bash_profile
    ```
  - Add the following line to the end of the file, replacing `<installation_path>` with the actual path where PostgreSQL is installed (e.g., `/Library/PostgreSQL/16/bin`):
    ```
    export PATH=$PATH:<installation_path>
    ```
  - Save and close the file.
  - Restart Terminal or run `source ~/.bash_profile` for the changes to take effect.

- **Creating a Database**:
  - Open Terminal and type:
    ```
    psql -U postgres
    ```
  - You may be asked to enter a password. If you don't have one yet, press enter to skip.
  - After connecting to PostgreSQL, create a new database using the following SQL command:
    ```
    CREATE DATABASE database_name;
    ```
  - Connect to the newly created database:
    ```
    \c database_name
    ```
  - Import the database schema dump by typing:
    ```
    \i /path/to/db_import.sql
    ```
  - To verify, enter `\dt` to list the tables.  

### Cloning the Github repository
  - Before we can connect the database to our codebase, we must first clone our backend environment's repository.
  - Clone the repository from [Menumatic Backend Github Page](https://github.com/team-havstrut-2024/menumatic-backend) into any directory of your choice.

### Creating a Maven Project (Instructions are for Intellij):
  - Run Intellij Ultimate Edition (any edition works fine).
  - Select ``` New project from existing sources ```
  - Choose the folder in which you cloned the repository and press OK.
  - Choose Maven and press OK.
  - Verify that the pom.xml file matches the one on Github.

### Connecting to the database via Spring JDBC
  - Now we are ready to connect our codebase to the database.
  - Navigate to the "resources" folder and open the ``` application.properties ```.
  - Modify the `spring.datasource.url`, `spring.datasource.username`, and `spring.datasource.password` to match your PostgreSQL credentials and database name.

  - Looking at the:
    ```
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/menumatic
    ```
    The ``` /menumatic ``` represents the name of your database. Meaning, replace "menumatic" with whatever you named your database.
  - Modify the values below to match your PostgreSQL credentials:
    ```
    spring.datasource.username=<your username, usually is "postgres">
    spring.datasource.password=<password, empty if you have none>
    ```
  - Now we are ready to run the application.
  - Run the application by running `MenumaticApplication`.

#### Alternatively, you can connect to the database via IntelliJ (Ultimate Edition):
  - On the right side of IntelliJ, press on the database logo.
  - Click on `New` -> `Data Source` -> `PostgreSQL`.
  - Enter your username and password.
  - `Database: <Name of your database>`.
  - Test the connection, apply, and then OK.
